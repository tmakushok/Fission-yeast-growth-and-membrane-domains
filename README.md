This code is intended to be used for the analysis of the following parameters in fission yeast: 1) cell growth dynamics (how cell width and volume change over time + how cell ends grow individually); 2) the dynamics of the redistribution of specialized membrane domains within the plasma membrane.

The inputs for this workflow are: 1) phase contrast image stacks (for detecting cell outline and for cell growth analysis); 2) fluorescence image stacks with specialized membrane domains visualized using a live marker.
