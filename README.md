This code is intended to be used for the analysis of the following parameters in fission yeast:
1) Cell growth dynamics (how cell width and volume change over time + how cell ends grow individually);
2) The dynamics of the redistribution of specialized membrane domains within the plasma membrane.

The inputs for this workflow are:
1) Phase contrast image stacks (for detecting cell outline and for cell growth analysis);
2) Fluorescence image stacks with specialized membrane domains are visualized with a live marker.
